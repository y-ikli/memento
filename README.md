This repository serves as both a personal knowledge base — a memento of the technologies and tools I explore — and a portfolio showcasing selected projects I’ve worked on or am currently developing.

It reflects my ongoing learning journey, practical experience, and areas of technical interest, with the goal of deepening my understanding while making useful resources available to others.

Please note: as some of my professional experiences involved sensitive environments where privacy and confidentiality are paramount, no proprietary data, internal resources, or privileged information are shared on this site.
