## About me

![Profile picture](images/photo_younes_gris.JPG){ width="200" style="border-radius: 0%;" }


My journey into the world of technology began in 2007 with a deep fascination for GNU/Linux systems. Distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora, along with Bash scripting and the free softwares philosophy, captivated me and ignited a passion for self-directed learning in this dynamic ecosystem.

Motivated to expand my knowledge, I pursued a rigorous academic path alongside my professional endeavors. I earned:
- A Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science
- A Master's in Computer Science Education (MEEF)
- A Master's in Applied Data Science for Healthcare

These academic achievements, complemented by 10 months of internships focused on data science/engineering and valorization, have equipped me with a robust foundation in data processing and analysis.

## Professional Experience

Currently, I serve as an **R&D Engineer** at the [Inria Centre at the University of Lille](https://www.inria.fr/en), where I contribute to projects centered on decentralized and federated learning.
