## About me

![Profile picture](images/photo_younes_gris.JPG){ style="width: 20%; border-radius: 0%;" }



My journey into technology began in 2007 with a deep fascination for GNU/Linux systems and the philosophy of free and open-source software.

Driven to deepen my expertise, I undertook a rigorous academic path while working as a teacher. I earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, a Master's in Computer Science Education (MEEF), and a Master's in Applied Data Science for Healthcare. These studies were complemented by 10 months of internships in data science and engineering, as well as a professional machine learning project in collaboration with CHU Lille and the Clinical Investigation Centre.

This journey reflects not only my dedication to growth and continuous learning, but also the perseverance, adaptability, and technical curiosity that shape my professional mindset. I bring a strong sense of responsibility and a deep commitment to ethical and impactful work.



### Passion Becomes Profession
